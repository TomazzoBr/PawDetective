# Paw Detective

Paw Detective is a React Application that helps pet owners reunite with their lost animal friends and on the other side help people that come across a lost animal find its owner and help the pet return home.

Pets are a beloved member of the owner's family. Losing your pet can be overwheling and searching for your friend
can be stressfull. Owners are posting on different platforms and groups on social media, or even on trees! ads about their pet in hope that someone might contact them having good news.

Paw Detective is an app specifically dedicated to helping people bring pets back to their families.
